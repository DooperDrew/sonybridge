# 06 — QA & Validation

## Verification levels
1. **Automated unit/invariant tests:** run by the verification gate on every change (Core protocol codecs, framing, checksums, state transitions).
2. **Automated budget/soak tests:** automated measurement of NFR budgets (latency, memory working set, CPU utilization).
3. **Real-environment QA:** manual validation run on real physical Sony WH-1000XM3 hardware connected to Windows 10/11.
4. **System edge cases:** Windows sleep/wake, Bluetooth adapter toggle, out-of-range recovery, audio endpoint contention.

> A QA row is **Pass** only with empirical evidence (date, environment, who ran it, and logs/commit). Until then it stays **Pending**.
> Releases list which rows are still Pending.

## Edge Cases

| Test ID | Invariant | Procedure | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| QA-SYS-01 | Out-of-Range Recovery | Walk out of Bluetooth range until disconnected, then return | Daemon auto-reconnects with exponential backoff without crashing | Pending |
| QA-SYS-02 | Windows Sleep / Resume | Put Windows PC to sleep while connected, then wake PC | RFCOMM socket cleanly reopens upon Windows resume | Pending |
| QA-SYS-03 | Rapid Slider Thrashing | Rapidly drag the Ambient Sound slider back and forth 50 times | Debounce limits packet queue; no socket deadlock or buffer overflow | Pending |
| QA-SYS-04 | Corrupt Packet Handling | Send malformed / truncated packet bytes to parser | Parser safely discards packet; no panic or memory corruption | Pending |
| QA-SYS-05 | Adapter Disable | Disable Windows Bluetooth adapter via Settings while connected | App transitions cleanly to "Bluetooth Unavailable" state | Pending |

## Incident Protocol
1. Any discrepancy between expected and real behavior: check `docs/m0-spike-findings.md`.
2. If new behavior is discovered, capture the raw Bluetooth byte dump using `sonybridge-cli probe --dump`.
3. Open a GitHub issue labeled `bug` containing the raw hex dump, Windows OS build, and headphone firmware version.
4. Write a reproducing unit test fixture in `crates/sonybridge-core/tests/fixtures` before applying the fix.
